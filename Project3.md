# Project 3

## Question 1

After importing the Charleston asking price data, I trained it using a linear regression model. I used a for loop and the kfold method from sklearn to separate the data into 10 even folds (roughly 70 entries per fold) to test and train the data. The majority of data is used to train the model and then the remaining testing data is reserved for applying the model to see how well it actually performs, which helps to prevent overfitting. This yielded a training score of 0.019 and a testing score of -0.066. These are very low values, which indicates a poorly fit model.
