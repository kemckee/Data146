# Project 1

** Question 1

A package is a collection of related modules that are often used together. A Library is a collection of packages. To make a package accessible in python one must first make sure it is available for the current project. To do this in Pycharm, click on python interpreter in preferences and hit the + in the bottom corner if the desired package does not already appear on the list. Add the package and return to the coding screen. An import statement is then used to make the modules from the package available in the program. For example, we have used pandas and numpy, which are imported with this line of code:

```python
import pandas
import numpy as np
```

Notice that an alias is used to import numpy. This allows us to use np in place of numpy in the code, which can save space and time when writing programs.
