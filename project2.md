## Question 1

Continuous data is numerical data that provides quantitative information about a variable. Continuous data can be further broken down into interval and ratio variables. Interval variables are measured along a continuum where 0 is just another number along the continuum. Ratio variables are the same as interval variables with the exception that 0 indicates there is none of that variable.
