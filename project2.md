## Question 1

Continuous data is numerical data that provides quantitative information about a variable. Continuous data can be further broken down into interval and ratio variables. Interval variables are measured along a continuum where 0 is just another number along the continuum (ex. temperature in celsius). Ratio variables are the same as interval variables with the exception that 0 indicates there is none of that variable (ex. weight). Nominal variables are essentially categories or bins that split up the data set by some characteristic of interest (ex. parrots, songbirds, hawks). Ordinal data is similar to nominal data with the exception that the categories have a distinct order (ex. 1st, 2nd, 3rd place in a race). 

To illustrate these types of data imagine a dataset providing information about the yields of every potato farmer in Idaho. This dataset might include which types of potato each farmer chose to grow that year. Different types of potatoes are an example of nominal data. There might also be information about the weight in pounds of each farmer's yield, which would be an example of continuous data. The data set could also have subjective evaluations of the growing conditions for a given year as reported by the farmers on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being very poor and 5 being very good). This is an example of ordinal data because the values represent a distinct rank for the growing conditions. The features might be the different types of potato and growing conditions and the targets could be the yield for each type of potato. The goal of the analysis would then to be determine if certain potato types and self reported growing conditions correlated with higher yield. 


## Question 2

The first plot uses alpha and beta of 5 with a sample of 10000 data points, which yields a relatively normal distribution with a mean of 0.49650898128794346 and a median of 0.4967548121582548.

![]()

The second plot uses alpha of 0.5 and beta of 5 to produce a right skewed distribution. The mean is 0.08387259091317668 and the median is 0.040367671522080234.

![]()

The third plot uses alpha of 5 and beta of 0.5 to produce a left skewed distribution. The mean is 0.9117711226108247 and the median is 0.9540031869608877.
